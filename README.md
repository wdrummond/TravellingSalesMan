# TravellingSalesMan

this is a project written in C++ meant to find acceptable algorithms to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem.
There are two solutions in this project. A general one that I came up with first, and one in the file Good Cycle.
The Good Cycle solution should work on any of the given .txt files in less than 60 CPU seconds.
The .out files are the desired outputs of the solutions.
